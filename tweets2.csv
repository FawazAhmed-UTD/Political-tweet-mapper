24/24 This exploration of Ukraine‚Äôs counter offensive options ‚Äì my 50th thread of the war - hopefully provides insight into the kinds of considerations the Ukrainians have to work through to recapture its territory seized by Russia. End. (Image - @UAWeapons) https://t.co/ica1gTOkia
23/24 The Ukrainian President will have one eye on the progress of the counter offensives and one eye on ceasefire or peace negotiations. Ukrainian progress in their counter offensives will influence the timing and conduct of these negotiations.
"22/24 Regardless of the location of the counter offensives, this will be as much a political as a military decision. Ukraine's President will want to balance reclaiming Ukrainian territory while retaining Western support &amp; not pushing the Russians to use chem / nuclear weapons."
"21/24 Exploitation Limits. This will remain one of the most difficult issues for Ukrainian counter offensives. Do they seek to recapture ground taken by Russia since 24 February, or something less?"
"20/24 Strategic support will continue to be key. With the Russians stepping up their assault on Ukraine‚Äôs strategic capacity to defend itself, Ukraine may become increasingly reliant on western aid (and intelligence)."
"19/24 For this reason the Ukrainians will probably continue their continuous ‚Äònibbling away‚Äô at the Russians to seize back their territory, rather than a general offensive on all fronts."
"18/24 The 4th consideration is resources. Offensive operations are expensive in recon assets (to find, fix and kill the enemy), artillery, armour and mobility support (engineers), logistics and air support. Multitudes of each, combined in Brigades and Divisions, will be needed."
"17/24 The Ukrainian operational design will probably focus fighting power in one key area to ensure maximum chances of a break into Russian defensive zones, and exploitation thereafter. It will also be informed by air support available ‚Äì for ground support &amp; air defence."
"16/24 For Ukraine, they will need a design that considers how many offensives at once, and how each consecutive advance is sequenced. This design considers main effort, supporting efforts, command and control and opportunities to exploit breakthroughs."
"15/24 Operational Design. Operational design is an important component of military professionalism. Through good operational design, commanders and their staffs‚Äô sequence and orchestrate tactical goals and actions to meet strategic and political objectives."
"14/24 The location of the next Ukrainian counter offensive will also be influenced by their ability to concentrate the numbers of forces required for close combat, engineers, artillery &amp; air support, communications, logistics, psyops, EW, etc."
"13/24 There are two regions where the Ukrainians might focus their follow up counter offensive‚Äì the east and the south. They may choose one or the other, both concurrently, or both sequentially. It will be influenced by their operational design, which is the 3rd consideration."
"12/24 Location. Once the Ukrainians secure the Kharkiv area, they will need to hold it while deciding where their next counter offensive may take place."
"11/24 This would be a deliberate design decision by the Ukrainians, who have demonstrated tactical and operational excellence throughout the war. They have placed Russia commanders upon the ‚Äòhorns of a dilemma‚Äô as they slowly deplete their combat power in the east."
"10/24 Russian leaders have to decide whether the counter offensive is restricted to the Kharkiv area, or whether it poses a threat to their operations more broadly in the east. If it is the latter, it will have an impact on Russian reserves, logistic holdings &amp;  priorities."
"9/24 The Ukrainians have clearly decided that the timing for a counter offensive in the northeast was right. This not only seizes back territory captured by the Russians, it poses a real dilemma for senior Russian leaders."
"8/24 Timing. In war, the ability to exploit time is one of the most important considerations in the planning and execution of military activities. Colin Gray writes that ‚Äúevery military plan at every level of war is ruled by the clock.‚Äù"
"7/24 In answering this, I will use the same framework as my previous post on this issue issues: timing; location; design; resources; and limits of Ukrainian exploitation."
6/24 We might now ask the question of how far Ukraine might push its counter offensives?
"5/24 In the past week or so, we have seen the Ukrainians shift from tactical counter attacks to something that approaches a counter offensive in the northeast. Ukrainian forces have successfully pushed Russian forces out of artillery range of Kharkiv. https://t.co/F37o3w6eNS"
"4/24 Russian losses in senior leaders have also continued as they move their generals into forward tactical areas. The aim of these visits is for the generals to gain better situational awareness, and to ensure better combined arms / air-land integration. https://t.co/bgt3BrHIqI"
"3/24 Despite their concentration of forces in the east, the Russians have yet to make major progress. What progress they've made has been at considerable cost. And with no mobilisation announcement yesterday, troop shortfalls will start to hurt. https://t.co/BIXOvKCVSt"
It is 75 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. Today I provide an update on Ukraine‚Äôs options to exploit a faltering Russian offensive in the east. 1/24 (Image - @UAWeapons) https://t.co/NrB98s7UGH

"May 10th 1982: HMS Sheffield, hit six days earlier, is let slip by HMS Yarmouth on her way to South Georgia. She vanishes in a sea mist and is lost. Officially she sunk in rough seas, although rumours abound that she was scuttled by plastic explosives.
Goodbye ""Shiny Sheff"". https://t.co/EkqhLkzF8v"
"May 10th 1982: Former Falklands Governor Sir Cosmo Haskard, one of the most beloved former governors, relays a message of hope and goodwill to the Islanders on the ""Calling the Falklands"" radio programme. It is a big morale booster in the islands. https://t.co/3uE2T7pC1z"
"May 10th 1982: The ""Bristol Group"" leaves the UK, comprising Type 82 Destroyer HMS Bristol (joined by Type 42 HMS Cardiff from Gibraltar) plus Type 21 Frigates HMS Active &amp; Avenger, Leander class Frigates HMS Andromeda, Minerva &amp; Penelope and RFA's, Bayleaf and Olna. https://t.co/3Gc0M95P4F"
"May 10th 1982: The Fuerza Aerea Argentina issues a communique showing considerably more losses than previously admitted to: 10 dead, 4 missing &amp; 18 wounded. The true figures are anybody's guess. https://t.co/5CCAJPEzlg"
"May 10th 1982: Argentine submarine ARA San Luis fires two SST-4 torpedoes at HMS Arrow &amp; Alacrity. The first torpedo fails to leave its tube, the second hits HMS Arrow's Type 182 towed Torpedo Decoy, which does its job and saves the ship. A close call... But no banana. https://t.co/r0iZf34NvR"
"... Adding that it was, ""An outrageous attack that violates the most elemental human feelings ... an inhuman deed, a hideous, barbarian act that goes against all those values of the free world which the British government has claimed to defend and uphold.""

Pure propaganda..."
"May 10th 1982: Argentine News Agency Telam keeps up with the fake story of the Narwal, claiming it was an innocent trawler, and that the British ""did not hesitate to machine gun the rafts that were hurled to the sea by survivors, filled with sick &amp; wounded..."" (Continues) https://t.co/RiYZTmqtUO"
"May 10th 1982: The Argentine Junta issues Communique No. 40 declaring the entire South Atlantic a ""War Zone"". The official lines between a conflict and a war were becoming entirely blurred. https://t.co/pf8f3j2nh3"
"Cartoon Rick here on May 10th, and I hope you're all still enjoying the #Falklands war as it happened 40 years ago. There's more to come, mostly chat, and I'll be posting that later this afternoon... Stay tuned for more #Falklands40 action üòéüëç https://t.co/93FzABQIMf"

You don't want the smoke. You haven't seen anger until you have seen the wrath of God through His people."

If you are a major majority you don't need to protest to change minds. You don't need to fire bomb things. You don't need to have tantrums. Because you are a major majority. Only minorities that want to be heard and want a voice do these things. This is a huge narrative hoax....

24/24 This exploration of Ukraine‚Äôs counter offensive options ‚Äì my 50th thread of the war - hopefully provides insight into the kinds of considerations the Ukrainians have to work through to recapture its territory seized by Russia. End. (Image - @UAWeapons) https://t.co/ica1gTOkia
23/24 The Ukrainian President will have one eye on the progress of the counter offensives and one eye on ceasefire or peace negotiations. Ukrainian progress in their counter offensives will influence the timing and conduct of these negotiations.
"22/24 Regardless of the location of the counter offensives, this will be as much a political as a military decision. Ukraine's President will want to balance reclaiming Ukrainian territory while retaining Western support &amp; not pushing the Russians to use chem / nuclear weapons."
"21/24 Exploitation Limits. This will remain one of the most difficult issues for Ukrainian counter offensives. Do they seek to recapture ground taken by Russia since 24 February, or something less?"
"20/24 Strategic support will continue to be key. With the Russians stepping up their assault on Ukraine‚Äôs strategic capacity to defend itself, Ukraine may become increasingly reliant on western aid (and intelligence)."
"19/24 For this reason the Ukrainians will probably continue their continuous ‚Äònibbling away‚Äô at the Russians to seize back their territory, rather than a general offensive on all fronts."
"18/24 The 4th consideration is resources. Offensive operations are expensive in recon assets (to find, fix and kill the enemy), artillery, armour and mobility support (engineers), logistics and air support. Multitudes of each, combined in Brigades and Divisions, will be needed."
"17/24 The Ukrainian operational design will probably focus fighting power in one key area to ensure maximum chances of a break into Russian defensive zones, and exploitation thereafter. It will also be informed by air support available ‚Äì for ground support &amp; air defence."
"16/24 For Ukraine, they will need a design that considers how many offensives at once, and how each consecutive advance is sequenced. This design considers main effort, supporting efforts, command and control and opportunities to exploit breakthroughs."
"15/24 Operational Design. Operational design is an important component of military professionalism. Through good operational design, commanders and their staffs‚Äô sequence and orchestrate tactical goals and actions to meet strategic and political objectives."
"14/24 The location of the next Ukrainian counter offensive will also be influenced by their ability to concentrate the numbers of forces required for close combat, engineers, artillery &amp; air support, communications, logistics, psyops, EW, etc."
"13/24 There are two regions where the Ukrainians might focus their follow up counter offensive‚Äì the east and the south. They may choose one or the other, both concurrently, or both sequentially. It will be influenced by their operational design, which is the 3rd consideration."
"12/24 Location. Once the Ukrainians secure the Kharkiv area, they will need to hold it while deciding where their next counter offensive may take place."
"11/24 This would be a deliberate design decision by the Ukrainians, who have demonstrated tactical and operational excellence throughout the war. They have placed Russia commanders upon the ‚Äòhorns of a dilemma‚Äô as they slowly deplete their combat power in the east."
"10/24 Russian leaders have to decide whether the counter offensive is restricted to the Kharkiv area, or whether it poses a threat to their operations more broadly in the east. If it is the latter, it will have an impact on Russian reserves, logistic holdings &amp;  priorities."
"9/24 The Ukrainians have clearly decided that the timing for a counter offensive in the northeast was right. This not only seizes back territory captured by the Russians, it poses a real dilemma for senior Russian leaders."
"8/24 Timing. In war, the ability to exploit time is one of the most important considerations in the planning and execution of military activities. Colin Gray writes that ‚Äúevery military plan at every level of war is ruled by the clock.‚Äù"
"7/24 In answering this, I will use the same framework as my previous post on this issue issues: timing; location; design; resources; and limits of Ukrainian exploitation."
6/24 We might now ask the question of how far Ukraine might push its counter offensives?
"5/24 In the past week or so, we have seen the Ukrainians shift from tactical counter attacks to something that approaches a counter offensive in the northeast. Ukrainian forces have successfully pushed Russian forces out of artillery range of Kharkiv. https://t.co/F37o3w6eNS"
"4/24 Russian losses in senior leaders have also continued as they move their generals into forward tactical areas. The aim of these visits is for the generals to gain better situational awareness, and to ensure better combined arms / air-land integration. https://t.co/bgt3BrHIqI"
"3/24 Despite their concentration of forces in the east, the Russians have yet to make major progress. What progress they've made has been at considerable cost. And with no mobilisation announcement yesterday, troop shortfalls will start to hurt. https://t.co/BIXOvKCVSt"
It is 75 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. Today I provide an update on Ukraine‚Äôs options to exploit a faltering Russian offensive in the east. 1/24 (Image - @UAWeapons) https://t.co/NrB98s7UGH

"May 10th 1982: Argentine submarine ARA San Luis fires two SST-4 torpedoes at HMS Arrow &amp; Alacrity. The first torpedo fails to leave its tube, the second hits HMS Arrow's Type 182 towed Torpedo Decoy, which does its job and saves the ship. A close call... But no banana. https://t.co/r0iZf34NvR"
"... Adding that it was, ""An outrageous attack that violates the most elemental human feelings ... an inhuman deed, a hideous, barbarian act that goes against all those values of the free world which the British government has claimed to defend and uphold.""

Pure propaganda..."
"May 10th 1982: Argentine News Agency Telam keeps up with the fake story of the Narwal, claiming it was an innocent trawler, and that the British ""did not hesitate to machine gun the rafts that were hurled to the sea by survivors, filled with sick &amp; wounded...""

"I'd give my left nut to see the treasonous bastards and bitches in the DC sewer get arrested, perp walked, in cuffs, and shackles on live television for the whole world to see, including FBI, DOJ, DHS, media traitors, each and every one! 

Until that happens, we have no country!"
"Bette Midler says every woman &amp; girl should take a knee during National Anthem. Every one of those Hollywood pieces of shit got to where they are  by getting on their knees, Otherwise they would all feel our pain as regular tax paying civilians. You must RESPECT AMERICA or LEAVE!"
Zelensky doesn't need anymore of my fucking tax money!!  This shit has to stop.
Any Republican who votes to send more of our fucken money to Ukraine is losing their job
"Biden says: ""The bottom line is this; My top priority is fighting inflation."" What do YOU believe is Biden's ""top priority?"""
Do you believe the 2020 election was stolen?
Your grocery store's shelves are empty. But Hunter Biden's bank account is full.
"I could not stand Obama, but now Biden is by far worse. Both are bad for our country and are causing all this pain. Pence should have done the right thing after the election but he was afraid and failed."

The reason #2000Mules is being ghosted by the media &amp; most politicians is obvious. It's true. They have no idea what to do next. They can't admit it but they also know they can't dismiss it on it's merits. They have to pretend it is simply not happening. That's not sustainable.

@FDPCubaUS It's obvious how Biden &amp; Mayorkas are determined to allow in as many radical potential future Democrat voters freely enter America across the Texan Border...Meanwhile blocking Cuban refugees because they're mostly Conservatives with strong family values.
@GovRonDeSantis @FDPCubaUS This is the exact reason why money is false!!  Who gives a shit if you collected $14 M pieces of paper!!  Those papers don‚Äôt make the world run!  It‚Äôs the hard working people that make it run everyday!!  We must unite!!  For the #PeopleParty !!  Remove all wealth and politicians

@JackPosobiec @HuntTerrie Also do you really think Republicans or Democrats want Trump back he stopped all of the money laundering and all of the illegal money that they‚Äôve been stealing from the taxpayers for 50+ years both sides are corrupt and want illegal money flowing to them Trump starts all that
I just watched 2000 Mules and  I feel sick to my stomach. What they did to Trump and his supporters is unforgivable üò°
We are already engaged in a civil war right now.
The reason #2000Mules is being ghosted by the media &amp; most politicians is obvious. It's true. They have no idea what to do next. They can't admit it but they also know they can't dismiss it on it's merits. They have to pretend it is simply not happening. That's not sustainable.

"May 9th 1982: Argentina begins the show ""24 Hours for Malvinas"" hosted by TV veterans Cacho &amp; Pinky. It is essentially a 24 hour telethon to raise money for the war, with Argentine TV, sporting &amp; film stars all giving support, and the slogan ""Help with money""... https://t.co/Sn1rLpHBvF"
@Polaris47862489 @FirstFalklands And the Renault 4 - that was ace.
@FirstFalklands Indeed!
@FirstFalklands Never trust the French! The only good thing ever to come out of France were the British troops at Dunkirk! ....And my French teacher's wife - after I told him that (!!)
They‚Äôve put the radio on at work and all it‚Äôs doing is intensifying my hatred of todays chad pop music‚Ä¶ And is it a legal requirement that Ed Sheeran is played constantly? Because the little child sized guitar playing ponce seems to be on every bastard 3 songs.. Kill me now..

"May 9th 1982: British Intelligence believes four AM39 Exocets have been sent by France to Argentina, and appeals to have them stopped, France is considering sending more through Spain in 10 days time. Argentina is also trying to buy them from Brazil, South Africa, Libya and Iraq. https://t.co/gdv2DjXszN"
"May 9th 1982: The British Embassy in Washington sends a message, claiming that certain Argentine factions are calling for ""A few more military blows"" such as the sinking of Belgrano, to help topple the junta. Haig seems all for it, although perhaps not on the same scale... https://t.co/3WbLCUE3ru"
"The MOD echoes the statement, with spokesman Ian Macdonald stating, ""The Ministry of Defence deplores these allegations which are, of course, completely without foundation."" https://t.co/FCLlhZ8pd1"
"May 9th 1982: Amid Argentine claims of a merciless slaughter on the Narwal, British press reports that ""The two Sea Harrier pilots from HMS Hermes treated the Argentine claim as 'Beneath contempt'... It was totally untrue."" https://t.co/76EZkR2hDc"
"May 9th 1982: #OTD in the #Falklands War, two Argentine A-4C Skyhawks of FAA Grupo 4 are lost in bad weather and crash. One is later found on South Jason Island, the second is never found. Lieutenants Casco and Farias are killed... It is becoming an expensive day for Argentina. https://t.co/dNbYfn4YNf"
"In fact, only one man is killed &amp; 11 wounded, but Argentina soon knocks together a fake distress call, played on the radio, of the men being exterminated, the last of whom goes down with a noble ""Viva la Patria"".

An article about the ship here :

"May 9th 1982: Argentine radio &amp; TV soon claims that the Narwal was merely a peaceful fishing vessel needlessly attacked, spinning a fraudulent tale of British helicopter crews mercilessly machine gunning the crew in the water, killing them all... https://t.co/bl8vFVEKQ9"
"May 9th 1982: Picking up the Mayday calls of the Narwal, Argentine forces send a Puma helicopter with three crew to hopefully recover the men of the boat, unaware that she is now in British hands. HMS Coventry fires Sea Dart and the Puma is destroyed with all hands lost. https://t.co/SNUXivaf8n"
"A 1,000lb bomb strikes the bridge of the Narwal without exploding, and the Harriers strafe the ship. The SBS soon move in via Sea King and capture the ship and crew, including Capt. Juan Carlos Gonzalez of the Argentine Information Service. Boatswain Omar Rupp is killed. https://t.co/hnaOsemQzV"
"Curiously, from 03.40-05.55 Argentine radars show hundreds of small targets approaching, which they believe to be landing craft &amp; helicopters ready to begin a direct assault. Clever jamming or chaff is presumed to have been the cause."
"May 9th 1982: At 08.35, two Sea Harriers from HMS Hermes, having found low cloud obscuring targets around Stanley, return to base. They spot the ARA Narwal, an Argentine spy ship, which was being used to gather intelligence inside the TEZ, and receive permission to attack... https://t.co/KmsVQkE106"
"May 9th 1982: At first light FAA Lear Jets scramble from Rio Grande air base towards the task force in order to provide false radar signatures simulating a sortie, hoping to draw away the British ships, but they are already heading back out to sea. https://t.co/W70xhsHiSV"
"May 9th 1982: HMS Alacrity fires 93 shells into Argentine targets around the airport &amp; isthmus where the RI25 are dug in, from 01.30-04.30 in bursts of 6-8 at a time. Casualties not recorded, though a Puma helicopter suffers tail &amp; rotor damage. Return fire heavy but inaccurate. https://t.co/zBD1fwOGem"

@boringcompany If you are serious about land tunnels i would reconsider an electromagnetic surface system // rail gun&gt; RG//.  Maybe using ocean transport for initial distribution of products and RG parts.

"@SueLincoln5 @DonaldJTrumpJr It's amusing that you think abortions are being banned! Who is banning abortions? Read some real news for once, they are just giving power back to the states"
"@SueLincoln5 @DonaldJTrumpJr Are you aware of the regulations on firearms? Would you be ok with a background check prior to an abortion? A waiting period? Remember, you gotta be at least 21 and file for for a license before you can even buy a firearm."

24/24 This exploration of Ukraine‚Äôs counter offensive options ‚Äì my 50th thread of the war - hopefully provides insight into the kinds of considerations the Ukrainians have to work through to recapture its territory seized by Russia. End. (Image - @UAWeapons) https://t.co/ica1gTOkia
23/24 The Ukrainian President will have one eye on the progress of the counter offensives and one eye on ceasefire or peace negotiations. Ukrainian progress in their counter offensives will influence the timing and conduct of these negotiations.
"22/24 Regardless of the location of the counter offensives, this will be as much a political as a military decision. Ukraine's President will want to balance reclaiming Ukrainian territory while retaining Western support &amp; not pushing the Russians to use chem / nuclear weapons."
"21/24 Exploitation Limits. This will remain one of the most difficult issues for Ukrainian counter offensives. Do they seek to recapture ground taken by Russia since 24 February, or something less?"
"20/24 Strategic support will continue to be key. With the Russians stepping up their assault on Ukraine‚Äôs strategic capacity to defend itself, Ukraine may become increasingly reliant on western aid (and intelligence)."
"19/24 For this reason the Ukrainians will probably continue their continuous ‚Äònibbling away‚Äô at the Russians to seize back their territory, rather than a general offensive on all fronts."
"18/24 The 4th consideration is resources. Offensive operations are expensive in recon assets (to find, fix and kill the enemy), artillery, armour and mobility support (engineers), logistics and air support. Multitudes of each, combined in Brigades and Divisions, will be needed."
"17/24 The Ukrainian operational design will probably focus fighting power in one key area to ensure maximum chances of a break into Russian defensive zones, and exploitation thereafter. It will also be informed by air support available ‚Äì for ground support &amp; air defence."
"16/24 For Ukraine, they will need a design that considers how many offensives at once, and how each consecutive advance is sequenced. This design considers main effort, supporting efforts, command and control and opportunities to exploit breakthroughs."
"15/24 Operational Design. Operational design is an important component of military professionalism. Through good operational design, commanders and their staffs‚Äô sequence and orchestrate tactical goals and actions to meet strategic and political objectives."
"14/24 The location of the next Ukrainian counter offensive will also be influenced by their ability to concentrate the numbers of forces required for close combat, engineers, artillery &amp; air support, communications, logistics, psyops, EW, etc."
"13/24 There are two regions where the Ukrainians might focus their follow up counter offensive‚Äì the east and the south. They may choose one or the other, both concurrently, or both sequentially. It will be influenced by their operational design, which is the 3rd consideration."
"12/24 Location. Once the Ukrainians secure the Kharkiv area, they will need to hold it while deciding where their next counter offensive may take place."
"11/24 This would be a deliberate design decision by the Ukrainians, who have demonstrated tactical and operational excellence throughout the war. They have placed Russia commanders upon the ‚Äòhorns of a dilemma‚Äô as they slowly deplete their combat power in the east."
"10/24 Russian leaders have to decide whether the counter offensive is restricted to the Kharkiv area, or whether it poses a threat to their operations more broadly in the east. If it is the latter, it will have an impact on Russian reserves, logistic holdings &amp;  priorities."
"9/24 The Ukrainians have clearly decided that the timing for a counter offensive in the northeast was right. This not only seizes back territory captured by the Russians, it poses a real dilemma for senior Russian leaders."
"8/24 Timing. In war, the ability to exploit time is one of the most important considerations in the planning and execution of military activities. Colin Gray writes that ‚Äúevery military plan at every level of war is ruled by the clock.‚Äù"
"7/24 In answering this, I will use the same framework as my previous post on this issue issues: timing; location; design; resources; and limits of Ukrainian exploitation."
6/24 We might now ask the question of how far Ukraine might push its counter offensives?
"5/24 In the past week or so, we have seen the Ukrainians shift from tactical counter attacks to something that approaches a counter offensive in the northeast. Ukrainian forces have successfully pushed Russian forces out of artillery range of Kharkiv. https://t.co/F37o3w6eNS"
"4/24 Russian losses in senior leaders have also continued as they move their generals into forward tactical areas. The aim of these visits is for the generals to gain better situational awareness, and to ensure better combined arms / air-land integration. https://t.co/bgt3BrHIqI"
"3/24 Despite their concentration of forces in the east, the Russians have yet to make major progress. What progress they've made has been at considerable cost. And with no mobilisation announcement yesterday, troop shortfalls will start to hurt. https://t.co/BIXOvKCVSt"
It is 75 days since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began. Today I provide an update on Ukraine‚Äôs options to exploit a faltering Russian offensive in the east. 1/24 (Image - @UAWeapons) https://t.co/NrB98s7UGH
"2/24 The Russians have reoriented their operational design to focus on eastern Ukraine as its main effort, with the south being a supporting effort. They have also stepped up their strategic operations to degrade Ukraine‚Äôs defensive capacity. https://t.co/EIkK1fCdTL"

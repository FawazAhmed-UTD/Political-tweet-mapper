The people who have defended this police department owe the Black residents of Minneapolis an apology.
"Two years after George Floyd‚Äôs murder, we have yet to see meaningful change from the Minneapolis Police Department.

I have to ask: what will it take?"
"- In 23.9% of use of force files, there is evidence in the file that contradicts or disputes the information that an officer recorded. MPD uses officers as field trainers even after the Police Chief has sustained findings of excessive force against them."
"An MPD officer responded, ‚ÄúAgreed,‚Äù and ‚ÄúFuck these people.‚Äù
- Supervisors failed to complete a thorough and sufficient review of an officer‚Äôs use of force in 48.2% of cases."
"Then, one MPD supervisor said to another officer, ‚ÄúTonight it was just nice to hear we are going to go find some people. Instead of chasing people around, we are going to hunt them. You guys are out hunting people now. It‚Äôs just a nice change of tempo.‚Äù"
"During that incident, MPD officers called a Black man, who was on the ground with his hands out and obeying commands, a ‚Äúfuckin‚Äô piece of shit,‚Äù while one of the officers repeatedly kicked him in the face."
"- MPD maintains a culture where MPD officers consistently use racist, misogynistic, and disrespectful language and are rarely held accountable
- During an incident in 2020, an officer should have intervened while other officers inappropriately used force."
"- In one case, an MPD officer used an MPD covert account to pose as a Black community member to send a message to a local branch of the NAACP criticizing the group."
"In contrast, MPD officers did not similarly track and surveil white people unrelated to criminal activity using MPD covert social media accounts."
"- üö©MPD uses covert social media to target Black leaders, Black organizations, and elected officials, unrelated to criminal activity, without a public safety objective."
"- One Black woman reported that she lost her housing because she had to decide between paying her rent or paying her attorney to challenge a wrongful citation. The charge was ultimately dismissed, but as of 2021, she was still living out of her car."
"- Black individuals comprise 19% of the Minneapolis  population yet make up 78% of all searches conducted during traffic stops.
- MPD officers are more likely to use force against Black individuals during a traffic stop than white individuals in similar circumstances"
"- Although Black individuals comprise about 19% of the Minneapolis population, 63% of all use of force incidents that MPD officers recorded were against Black individuals."
"Today, @mnhumanrights found a deliberate ‚Äúpattern or practice of race discrimination in violation of the Minnesota Human Rights Act‚Äù by the Minneapolis Police Department

@bhensel2009 @BorislavKostad1 @elonmusk That must be the dumbest hypocrisy ever... hey Somalia weekly we will bomb you causing chaos and food disparity that we will send foreign aid to your country so your government can hide or fund terrorists so we can continue to bomb your innocent.

"@KristinRaworth You are not a real feminist if you think a woman, any woman needs to explain a medical choice for themselves. Its very much the same. 

My body my choice on all fronts. No government has any governance on my body."
Here is what I don't get in the US... they don't pay for any medical care at all. If I decided to go get a rare cancer treatment that I paid for no one would comment... what's the difference. You don't pay for any treatments why does your government think they can decide now?
@CourtesaWall @thedogralaranch But many pro choice demanded people suck it up or face consequences. Imagine if anti-abortionists want to have you fired from your job because at one point a woman made that choice. Do those women have to deal with the consequence of their choice. No.

@RBReich You know Congress and the Governors have never ratified Women Equality. Imagine that and you think they will enact a law.
@a_bbound @TristinHopper Does Alberta look like California... because that's a naive perception. We have a Charter of Rights that was established in the 60s. Very different legal structure.
@TristinHopper @WatcherAfar How many times I tell people that my current Conservative leader of Ontario isn't actively pursuing to dismantle OHIP. And that our Universal Healthcare is not ever debated during elections. We are NOT the same.
"@MaximeBernier While also deciding if she is physically or emotionally willing to carry a fetus for 40 weeks. 

Body autonomy is the only way forward for real female equality. No medical procedures are more debated than the ones that cis gender females want. 

Women are not political pawns."
@crafty_caro @zoewhittall You can do a copper IUD but they have been known to implant into the uterine lining require a very painful extraction. So no hormone but higher risk
@zoewhittall Cause many women I know got pregnant with an IUD in having to attempt to removing it while saving the pregnancy.
@CLeduc123 @GB2062 @melaniejoly In Canada you don't have to legalize a medical procedure. Imagine if you decided to mandate all medical decisions. What doctors and patients decide is no one's business. That should be the only law.
@melaniejoly So did you vote for female autonomy when the Bloc put in a motion yesterday or did you side with your party line not to agree with the Bloc ever?
@MisaPb J'en peux plus. Ils sont tous connards. My equality is no longer up for discussion I am taking it. I am owning it and I will fight for it til my death.
Hey @LoniLove you missed the point of the @amyschumer dress that is very much on the gilded era theme. Poor women didn't where hoop skirts. Chloe dressed her in a the average woman clothing of the period.
@AureliaCotta Canadian hospitals do not participate in late term abortions. Its usually standard practice that post 22wks a doctor in Canada is not to abort a healthy heart beating fetus. But if you see my last tweet my still birth miscarriage would be seen as an abortion in the US.
"I birthed my dead baby. 4 days after not hearing a heart beat on the doppler or seeing it on the US monitor... I had to force birth my baby. That is seen as an abortion to many it would in the US. 

Female maternal health doesn't belong to any governments. 

#RoeVWade #feminist"
@elonmusk You trolling everyone today???
@IsisWise @MariekeWalsh So why not vote for it unanimously. Because he is a fake feminist. He won't give us full autonomy.
People... how did the @JustinTrudeau and @theJagmeetSingh and their party not vote in favour for female body autonomy??? WTF Canada... they tell you abortion is a right but the idea of women being in control of their bodies is not ok. You 2 are fake feminist. #abortionrights https://t.co/vTAyMTdBTN
My baby died inside of me at 20 weeks. It didn't create a spontaneous birth. My doctor had to force my baby out. I had to birth my dead baby before it poisoned me from the inside. I had to abort my pregnancy. I would be penalized if it became a crime. #AbortionIsEssential https://t.co/CJityNBT1K

@LostGhostGal But how? Well just make a place where they turn all the cons into pros. Like necromancy in fantasy is usually looked down on. But what if it is just ‚Äúhey menial labor is out of the way so people have more free time for things‚Äù. Vampires value blood over money so that‚Äôs the tax.
"@LostGhostGal I want a world where being a vampire isn‚Äôt a thing that people feel compelled to hide, even it is is just one chill society in a world of hate.

Marjorie Taylor Greene has had multiple extramarital affairs. I wonder how many abortions she‚Äôs had?
Every child had a heartbeat before being shot dead in school. Where's that righteous pro-life outrage?
@VGWelland @__Keats__ I‚Äôll never understand that whole idea. They‚Äôre both kids. Just because someone is 18 years + 1 day doesn‚Äôt suddenly make them a criminal for engaging in the same behavior they did 3 days earlier. It‚Äôs really a stupid concept.
"@krissDudley100 @VGWelland @__Keats__ Oh dude get a grip. My first gf lost her virginity to me at 14, I was 16. Nearly every girl I knew in high school was full on sexually active by age 15-16."

@__Keats__ As long as they practice safe sex.
@megsymegs @teninabed @__Keats__ Depends what state you‚Äôre in. The age of consent is 14 in some states.

@__Keats__ My 14yo is very responsible &amp; not one to lose her head over romance. She presents as older. I‚Äôd vet the guy then let them have supervised dates. Let him hang out with the fam. I‚Äôd like her to take things slow but I lost my virginity at 15 and it didn‚Äôt ruin my life by any means.

@tszzl Important to whom? Certainly not to the underlying humans. And not to future generations who wouldn‚Äôt exists but for presently alive generations. Maybe more important to some alien civilization?
@tedlieu Trump clearly lost the election. But the statement of a news network made as part of a settlement does not count as evidence for that. We didn‚Äôt learn anything we didn‚Äôt already know from this.
"@Finke81 @danibarondess @georgemasonlaw I don‚Äôt. Either do you. But given he is a law professor undoubtedly familiar with Sotomayor‚Äôs famous ‚Äúwise Latina‚Äù quote, it is the best inference that this was the cause, I think."

"@tedcruz Could be just an expression.

#ProbablyNotReallyACallToArms"
@Finke81 @danibarondess @georgemasonlaw I don‚Äôt know what he is doing. But I think we should shift to debating ideas rather than the morality of speakers. Poor thinking and faulty generalizations are common. I don‚Äôt think it is best approached as a moral defect just because the topic involves race or identity.
"@Finke81 @danibarondess @georgemasonlaw I am pretty sure saying you are wiser than someone is a way of saying you make better decisions than they do. And here, on the basis of a superior perspective arising from experiences related to race.

She is certainly engaging in a lot of racial generalization here."
"@Finke81 @danibarondess @georgemasonlaw need to perform moral evaluations of people who think illogical thoughts or have poorly thought through beliefs. Instead, dialogue will enable people to come to better thinking on their own."
"@Finke81 @danibarondess @georgemasonlaw No ideas should be off limits, not even racist ideas. People do not learn by cutting off the thought process or engaging in lobotomies.

The reason that racist ideas should be rejected is because they are incorrect ideas.

Free thinking leads to non-racist results. We don't..."
"@Finke81 @danibarondess @georgemasonlaw She basically said she was wiser than white males. I am sure there is a difference, but I don't think it is meaningful. In Sotomayor I see someone trying to work through their thinking. She is confused and wrong. But the solution is for her to work on her thinking."
"@Finke81 @danibarondess @georgemasonlaw any other sort of belief system. I think eventually censorship culture will extend even beyond identity issues if not contained.

More debate and less trying to establish moral superiority would be progress."
"@Finke81 @danibarondess @georgemasonlaw Basically, we have gotten to the point where any negative stereotype about any group of people is considered to be a form of bigotry. But I don't think that is helpful. I think people should think THROUGH their negative stereotypes and evaluate such ideas critically. As with..."
"@Finke81 @danibarondess @georgemasonlaw their comments are sufficient to establish that.

@Finke81 @RBReich I am not saying it is the only way or that I agree with the law.
@Finke81 @RBReich But that isn‚Äôt the motive. The motive and the wisdom of the law are two different things.
@Finke81 @RBReich We are talking past each other. You are talking about the merits of the law and I and I am talking motives.
"@Finke81 @RBReich You are arguing against the law, but I don‚Äôt think people are necessarily thinking about it at that level. To the extent we are discussing motives."
"@Finke81 @RBReich That is what motivates most people, I would bet."
"@Finke81 @RBReich I agree with you, as I have already said. But we are discussing the motive, which is to preserve the status quo because the situation makes people confused."
@Finke81 @RBReich You are emphasizing the crime aspect of this. But that is just how the government regulates anything. It doesn‚Äôt necessarily reflect animus.
@Finke81 @RBReich I agree. I am just saying avoiding that issue is the motive for the law.
@Finke81 @RBReich I agree it cuts both ways.
@Finke81 @RBReich Right. They might make a permanent mistake as a minor making a decision that traditionally has not been available.
"@Finke81 @RBReich How is not wanting minors to make decisions with permanent consequences animus? It is the opposite. It may be right or wrong, but it isn‚Äôt animus."
@Finke81 @RBReich Right. So this is why the issue is ‚Äúgenuinely difficult.‚Äù Because consequences flow both ways.
@Finke81 @RBReich The one I articulated is the better motive for someone to have.
"@Finke81 @RBReich I am thinking of medical procedures with permanent consequences. Not say, psychotherapy."
@Finke81 @RBReich I think people have multiple motives. That is a better motive.
@Finke81 @RBReich Does this healthcare include any permanent medical decisions?
@Finke81 @RBReich I am just saying that the motive is doubting that young people should make such serious decisions.
"@Finke81 @danibarondess @georgemasonlaw I am just saying that if we allow positive stereotypes based on ethnicity, we must also allow negative ones. I think it is better to not generalize at all.

Even positive stereotypes can be a burden for those who don‚Äôt match the stereotype."

"@jonathanchait Your own article cites a study that lifting tariffs would only reduce inflation by 1.3%. The tariffs are not the main driver of inflation and repealing them won‚Äôt save the Dems. Also, have you seen what COVID-19 lockdowns have done to China-based supply chains?"
"@RBReich You ever notice how you think negative stereotypes directed at this particular group are OK but would probably not like negative stereotypes directed at any other group?

This identity politics reasoning of yours is divisive and counterproductive."
"@scottlincicome @mattyglesias @dandrezner I get that tariffs distort economic decisions. But so do income taxes. Why tariffs are the WORST way to generate revenue is under theorized. And when it comes to tariffs on China, the economic distortion seems like a good thing."
@LizMair Are tariffs worse than other taxes?

@awstar11 I don‚Äôt think Trump was rightly vilified. I think a lot of opportunities for cooperation were ruined when Dems chose to vilify Trump. There is this tricky thing where the parties both need to compete and cooperate. You can‚Äôt expect it to always be clean.
"@mattyglesias I am not sure the value of Bitcoin is objective. It has no use, other than trading."
@awstar11 I agree with you about the office of the President. But that has always been a matter of appearances to some extent. That doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt matter though.
@awstar11 I assume that some of this juvenile behavior will occur but that adult thinking will prevail in the end. You can‚Äôt have competition between two groups without some people going overboard on each side. Each party is looking for the ‚Äúkiller issue‚Äù that will allow them to prevail.
@alexthechick are always motivated logic rather than emotion is also likely to lead one astray. Plenty of protesters haven‚Äôt really conceptualized any end game. It is like the dog chasing the car. What exactly would you do if you caught it?

@alexthechick Triple dog??? I can‚Äôt believe you went triple dog!!!
"@awstar11 There is a conflict. But it is exactly the right approach. Both parties ought to compete vigorously, criticize each other, and cooperate when they share common ground. I think both parties have been doing more cooperating on common ground lately, and that is good."
@NeverTr74704466 It is true!
@awstar11 I consider that progress. We wouldn‚Äôt want to go back even if we could.
"@awstar11 Well, in that case we will just have to agree. I think the suppression of the Hunter laptop story was wrong and I think SOME scientists have been talking down to the public in an obnoxious manner."
"@awstar11 I agree with you on Facebook and the scientists. They make something that is hard (figuring out the truth) even harder. But just because someone is wrong about X doesn‚Äôt mean they are wrong about Y. If it is important, we can‚Äôt let our dislike of someone influence our thinking."
"@alexthechick @wombat_socho I don‚Äôt favor a $3000 cap on capital losses. I also think long term capital gains should be taxed at ordinary tax rates. That would be slightly simpler than what we do now. But if it were really up to me, we would have a VAT instead of an income tax."
@awstar11 the rub. People need to educate themselves more so they are better equipped to think independently. I think many of the skeptics have been right to be skeptical but have reached incorrect conclusions.
"@awstar11 Well, this might be progress. Especially to the extent that it causes people to be good critical thinkers‚Ä¶ I have been in a weird position, thinking that COVID-19 guidelines (vaccination, masking, and social distancing) but supportive of people expressing skepticism. Here is‚Ä¶"

Dropping public mask mandates on travel‚Äî where people are literally packed together; when they are traveling to different places where they may seed more transmission; while we are greatly under-detecting cases as evidenced by wastewater‚Äî is a costly mistake at this time.

Isn't it about time for NY to reinstate #COVID19 mitigation measures that you removed prematurely weeks ago that allowed #BA2 to spread and hospitalize more New Yorkers every day?

"Just a note here as I‚Äôm seeing a few people taking offense at the suggestion that I may be ‚Äúshaming‚Äù hardworking New Yorkers for not doing enough. I‚Äôm *obviously* not attacking you. It was a rhetorical attack against our insane, wasteful worship of policing policy."
"Anytime you hear a ‚Äúrise in crime‚Äù or ‚Äúspike in shootings,‚Äù remember:  whatever they claim, is happening despite investing most on policing in the history of the world. A brutal indictment of the efficacy of policing. Yet police are using their pathetic failures to demand more?"
"Every time police can point to *any data that ‚Äúcrime is up,‚Äù NYPD demands more funds. Despite the fact that ‚Äúcrime being up‚Äù underscores their own failure to *prevent crime from being up despite a historically high, &amp; ever increasing $11 billion budget."
"The NYPD fundraising off of a tragedy is nothing new of course. They use outlier cases of violence they failed to prevent &amp;‚Äîmore often than not‚Äîsolve to demand taxpayers pay even more. When cops murder Black &amp; Brown people, they demand more for ‚Äútraining.‚Äù It‚Äôs always more. More."
"As more details emerge, how on earth are NYC taxpayers not in the streets *revolting* against even the *suggestion* they reward the NYPD for their remarkable failure before, during, &amp; after the NYC Subway shootings with even more funds than the $11 billion they already waste."
Did you hear the one about the NYPD trying to take credit for catching the NYC Subway Shooter? They didn‚Äôt catch Frank James. Frank James caught himself. He called the cops and gave them the address. They took so long picking him up he went to McDonalds for lunch.
"it‚Äôs the way that NYPD, with a whole shooter out loose in the streets of NYC, put me in JAIL yesterday (up until this morning) for walking through the emergency subway station doors."
How has NYC subway crime and ridership shifted since the pandemic--and before--and why? Read @ManhattanInst scholar @nicolegelinas's paper for data and policy answers: https://t.co/NLosuqWGZh
3.1 million trips on the subway yesterday despite some bold predictions that ridership would collapse due to safety concerns. That's 95% of ridership a week ago. https://t.co/oaocUMO1Zj
"It is insane Gov Hochul is comparing corporate giveaways to Billionaires to funding the @MTA that had (in 2019) a daily subway ridership of 5.5 million and an annual ridership roughly 1.698 billion. This statement alone should cost her re-election.

"I don‚Äôt believe Kevin Samuels is dead, for the record. But me not feeling bad if he is doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm ‚Äúcelebrating‚Äù it. He went out of his way to be cruel. 

We are not required to mourn virtues he didn‚Äôt show. And asking black women, of all ppl, to show tact is audacious"
"idk why ppl having the opinion ‚Äúif you glad kevin samuels might be dead then you‚Äôre weird‚Äù.

"History has taught us that when you begin to normalize the degradation of a marginalized community in public, then it will become acceptable in law. 

Wake the fuck up, people. 

""It's just my opinion"" on (insert social issue) isn't just an opinion that dies. 

It manifests."
"What we're being reminded in real time is that harmful ""opinions, thoughts, and ideas"" lead to harmful laws and setbacks.

"We are entering a moment in time when the most marginalized are tired of ""getting along just to get along"" with our oppressors. 

We're throwing hands, we're cursing them out in real time, we're shaming them for all of the violent things they continue to do. 

Bring it on."
"Kevin Samuels has made a career off of shamelessly disgracing Black women for profit. 

He emboldened the most toxic individuals to project tired and harmful narratives about Black women.

Dead or alive, what a disgraceful life to live. 

That's all I've got for that misogynist."
@boombamkaboom @ChimGAT Yes calling women linebackers is such a great legacy to leave behind. &amp; saying that children lie so we shouldn‚Äôt believe them when they say something bad happened.

"This same Kevin Samuels said that ""kids lie"" when it comes to sexual abuse or molestation and that a woman would be wrong to end a relationship going off the word of her daughter without questioning her. But ""he didn't hurt anyone"", ""he just had different opinions""."
"""Everybody dies"". So why are y'all crying over how people are reacting to his death? He's not here to read, see or hear any of it. You care because you don't want this to happen to you. Everyday y'all go on and on about wanting to leaving a legacy. This was his."
"Y'all have clowned all sorts of people on here when they've passed (and still do), but Kevin Samuels should be untouchable? The main reason you'd think that is because you found value in the things he said and the way he was, which is exactly why he's being clowned. Sad but true."
"As so many of you have rightly said, niggas die everyday. Being a black man doesn't mean that everyone should mourn you in death, especially if you were a shitty person in life. The world owes you nothing. Don't wanna be ridiculed in death? Don't be a shithead in life."
"A lot of you niggas are upset at people (specifically black women) disrespecting Kevin Samuels because you know that you‚Äôre just like him, and seeing the reaction to his passing scares the shit out of you, cos you don‚Äôt want the same for yourselves. Well."
"IDK why people are looking for sympathy for him on Twitter anyway. People on Twitter are cruel to the nicest people. Why would they be nice to a man who made a living belittling and demeaning, especially those in his own community, and usually women? Lol see you people crying."
"All I can say about Kevin Samuels is if you spend your time disrespecting people in life, don‚Äôt be surprised at people disrespecting you in death. No matter how cruel it may be, the legacy you leave behind will be known by the fruit you bore while you were here."

"Taurus Moons have an innate gift of making people feel safe in their presence; they know how to put anyone at ease. Their aura can tame a raging dragon. Because of this, they can easily earn the title of ""The People's Sweetheart""."
"Taurus Moon people are the poster children for emotional stability. The Moon rules emotions and when placed in Taurus, it gets to enjoy Taurus' stability and power hence why the Moon is exalted in Taurus."
"Taurus is an Earth sign and the Moon rules water. The ocean gets its shape because of the Earth surrounding it. The Earth also gives the ocean a place to crash, refresh and purge. Without the Earth, that couldn't happen. So Taurus Moons can help people to refresh and purge."
"Taurus is an Earth sign and the Moon rules water and emotions as stated previously. When water and earth mix, growth happens. This means that when Taurus Moon people cultivate healthy, benevolent emotions, they can make themselves, anyone or any dream/goal grow profoundly."
"Taurus Moons are also Verbal Magicians. Taurus rules the throat and astrologically, the Moon is deals with mysticism and the psychic realm. This means that Taurus Moon people are born with the gift of bringing their visualizations and desires to life by speaking them into being."

"Find tasks that align with Captivate, Create, Compete, Complete and start your day with those.

Focus on the fun to get your engine moving down the track.

Make that incremental progress.

Build the momentum."
"How do you do that?

Eat the ice cream first!"
"With ADHD, we‚Äôre always facing resistance.

Whether trying to move a stationary train, or climb a mountain, it‚Äôs all about building up that momentum.

Just enough to get you moving forward, one step at a time, until harder tasks become less daunting."
"It‚Äôs like trying to ride a bike uphill on the lowest gear.

One rotation of the pedals can technically get you further, but only if you can actually do the rotation.

To go up a truly steep hill, the amount of effort required is too much work to make any real progress."
"You can't tackle that difficult task.

You'll just end up staring at it all day, and get nothing done at all.

You try to get the train moving, but the weight is too much.

At the end of the day, you'll still be stuck in place on the tracks‚Äîexerting effort but getting nowhere."
"Popular productivity advice like ‚Äúeat the frog first‚Äù tells you to tackle the hardest task first.

But this advice is toxic for the ADHD brain!"
"This momentum builds coupler-by-coupler, car-by-car, until that single engine is moving at top speed with 12,000 tons behind it.

We often get stuck because we try to move the entire 12,000 tons at once."
"To get started, the train engine just has to move itself.

Once it moves forward just a tiny bit, the couplers connect and now both the engine and the first car start to move."
"A real train doesn't try to move everything in one motion.

That would be an impossible task.

It might have hundreds of cars, far too much weight to start everything moving at once.

So it uses couplers to connect each car which have a small gap between them."
"Living with ADHD is often about managing your energy by building momentum.

Think of your motivation like a train.

It starts motionless on the track, and nothing seems to get you moving."

We risk reifying the state created categories of our sexed bodies that they then weaponize to control and surveille us.
Moving forward if we fail to connect larger systems of state control to build larger movements for liberation &amp; demands for bodily autonomy we will lose. Women's liberation is central to resisting attacks on bodily autonomy &amp; women's liberation is inextricable from other demands
There is also a distinction to be made between people articulating needs for services and personal experiences and the way we talk about the systems and structures involved in restricting access to reproductive health care.
I agree with this and think that is how most people talk about it and simply want to note at times that some people who are not women can also become pregnant. What is jarring is the resistance to the peripheral acknowledgement of this fact. https://t.co/UOBmlng3Gv

"@AmandaMarcotte It's about sexuality, and it's about misogyny. People protested that clinic because they want to create a world where conservative Christianity wholly monopolizes sexual expression and gender roles.

Concern about ""life"" is decidedly secondary to this."
"In the beginning, I believed the weekly standoff at the clinic was about a difference in opinion about abortion. This didn't jive with the protestors hatred of birth control -- which of course prevents abortion -- or their preoccupation with sex. They talked about sex A LOT."
I stopped when the volunteer escort program was shut down because of increased insurance cost and liability risk due to increasing acts of violence. The clinic was forced to hire professional security.
"Any time a man approached (including me, before they recognized me) the antis would shout ""tell your girlfriend she doesn't have to do this!""

They *always* assume an abortion patient is 1.) not married and 2.) being coerced by a man

Both of these are ridiculous assumptions"
"I was always careful to hide my identity as an escort. I arrived on the bus, because people who drove there would have their license plate numbers run by the antis, who evidently had connections in government allowing these lookups, and who would then show up at their houses."

@randysfields @RavBogard Good question. The article I posted plus other sources I've read indicate that they were subjected to disinformation. Reagan supporters put out a barrage of misleading BS. Including a propaganda video done by Paul Weyrich in coordination with C. Everett Koop.

"@Barkley02883235 Yeah. It also feels like a vicious cycle. Saudi Arabia and other oil exporting countries create security problems that end up being addressed militarily, then the US goes into more debt and continues to be reliant on the petrodollar."
People on here lecturing about civility after Kavanaugh's neighbors arranged a peaceful demonstration. After there was a fucking violent attempted insurrection supported by the Republican Party. That should be astonishing but really it's so predictable.
@apokerplayer @Out5p0ken @BillKristol Oh please. Always concerned talk about civility when it's protests on the left. Remember their was a f'ing attempted insurrection supported by the Republican Party! Not to mention the countless other aggressive and sometimes violent right wing demonstrations that preceded that.

"By the way, Nixon gave us this system."
@SweetCainMusic Yes and I hear that all of the UK is taking an economic hit from Brexit and the worst is yet to come.
The US is both financing its foreign policy on the petrodollar while Saudi Arabia holds US foreign policy hostage. And now China wants in. This is a dangerous and unsustainable system. All the more reason the US must invest and become a leader in clean renewables.
Yeah it's a huge problem that the debt financed US military-industrial complex depends partly on the liquidity that the petrodollar provides. https://t.co/A7OpohrwVg
@Barkley02883235 This is a dangerous and unsustainable system. All the more reason that this country needs to invest and become a leader in clean renewables.
@Barkley02883235 I didn't know this. I looked this up and it's very concerning. The debt financed US military-industrial complex depends partly on the liquidity that the petrodollar provides. China is already trying to replace the US and Saudi Arabia is holding our foreign policy hostage.
@randysfields @RavBogard According to the article the community as a whole were more liberal on abortion than the general population. Some evangelicals even helped push for legalization in the years preceding Roe.
@Ar_De_122 Yes! I've been thinking the exact same thing. Iceland alone has a huge surplus of geothermal energy. Use that energy to produce hydrogen and transport it all over the world via fuel cells.
"These misleading arguments must be countered with clarity and context, based on a full understanding of what liberal and democratic principles actually mean."
"There is nothing liberal or democratic about restricting people's rights, using the government to uphold unjust power structures and blocking the will of the people to form a representational government."
"Senators talk about the filibuster as ""protecting norms"" and being necessary to protect liberal democracy, even when protecting this tradition means not protecting the right to vote itself. It's also a tradition that was created to protect the restriction of people's rights."
"This is why conservative forces in this country have constructed propaganda intending to obscure the meaning of liberal democracy. Decisions by the court to restrict rights and protect power are shrouded in ""states rights"" and ""independence of the judiciary""."
"As I've talked about before, disdain for liberal democracy is pervasive on the right but not among the general population."
Republicans say that any regulations for corporations is big government but regulations on the female reproductive system is cool.

Overturning Roe is part of the authoritarian agenda of the Roberts court.
@Lift_Our_Voice @kat____eye Like public televised hearings in June?
@Lift_Our_Voice @kat____eye When people identify with the protests it becomes much harder to portray them as an angry mob.
@Lift_Our_Voice @kat____eye Ah. Yeah there are different factions of the right.
@Lift_Our_Voice @kat____eye An official report that details the insurrection and gets lots of media attention would be good for Dems. But it's still in question if and when that is going to happen. I still think there are going to be lots people who aren't activists motivated in a way they weren't before.
@Lift_Our_Voice @kat____eye This is a Republican primary challenger?
@Lift_Our_Voice @kat____eye They think there is something wrong with us because we don't follow politicians like a cult like they do.
@kat____eye @Lift_Our_Voice Yeah but I think Roberts was making a calculation there. Roberts has been terrible for voting rights. I tweeted some information about that a while back.
@Lift_Our_Voice @kat____eye Yeah that seems accurate and I hadn't considered that.
@kat____eye @Lift_Our_Voice I read the ruling was expected in the summer but didn't see a specific month. They usually give big rulings in June but they could do it in November it they wanted to  A leak is a loss of control of the timing. Roberts is far to the right he is merely pragmatic in his extremism.
@Lift_Our_Voice @kat____eye Yeah they're not going to be able to portray reproductive rights protests through the same negative lens as they were able to portray Black Lives Matter protests.
"@kat____eye @Lift_Our_Voice As for protests being used to stoke divisions, I think there is a difference here. Because unfortunately too many white women that swing Republican didn't understand the importance of BLM but they sure can understand the importance of body autonomy."
@kat____eye @Lift_Our_Voice You have a point here. But I still think they would want the distraction later. True people aren't paying that much attention to the 1/6 committee. But I think that is because reasonable people already know what happened but we're all understandably skeptical of accountability.
@kat____eye @Lift_Our_Voice If we didn't know about it until the ruling there would have been much less time for Democrats to fundraise and organize. The Republicans also would have had more control over the messaging. How did this leak make Roberts seem less powerful? I don't understand your take on that.
@bret_rd @revelationxo They're actually talking about Cawthorne's shenanigans quite a bit but they should be talking about him and other Republicans being corrupt and insurrectionists.
Joe Manchin is unworthy of holding office. I just want to say that since I see people on here in various threads rush to defend him with the same old excuses. Just because he still has a D after his name doesn't mean he shares the values of the Democratic Party.
@kat____eye @Lift_Our_Voice Roberts is in agreement with the abortion ban so it's not a loss of control.
@kat____eye @Lift_Our_Voice It's bad for Republicans politically for it to come out now though. So that doesn't make sense. I also don't agree that Roberts is angry that Alito wrote the opinion because that would still have been the case anyway if this memo weren't leaked.
So abortion is not condemned in the Bible and Catholic Church doctrine didn't even have a problem with it up to the sixth month of pregnancy. Until some dude who became Pope decided in 1869 that women should be forced to give birth. https://t.co/AHdFuztFUQ
@CalltoActivism @Frank_Schaeffer Yes
@GermanGirl73 @AmyMcCampbell2 @BillSou @HarrisPeskin @TinaSmithMN Manchin isn't worthy of holding office. Why do supposed Democrats on here rush to defend him with the same old excuses?
Roberts is angry because the leaked memo foiled the plan to strike down Roe at a politically opportune time. Everything this SCOTUS does is political. Whoever leaked it deserves credit as a whistleblower.
@Cowboyzion01 @StateFarm I'm sorry that happened to you. I also feel a little uneasy about people judging me for my orientation and haven't felt that way for a long time. Bigotry is back. üòî

"@MikeRJohnson777 I feel like abortion is political cocaine for Republicans. They have to know that attacking women's reproductive rights reliably backfires. But they're addicted to chasing this power and how it amps up their small base, even though they're going to crash hard."
@PaulaProgressiv Oh I know. They're coming for my rights too.
@philyptian @PaulaProgressiv There really is no religious basis for the anti-abortion thing. In fact there are pro choice scriptures in the Torah. The anti-abortion thing is about control. Plain and simple.
The anti-abortion thing is not a religious thing. It's a control thing. Always has been.
@lasteve423 Yeah it's interesting to note that the Evangelical community used to be more liberal on abortion than the general population.
@JoeColac @MinnesotaMaryS @RonJohnsonWI I wonder if he actually believes this or if it's part of the whole GOP chaos strategy.
@PamFromPHMI @MonicaOBrien331 It would be interesting to see how these right wing hacks on the bench would handle a religious liberty argument on this. They'd have to reverse everything they claimed to care about if they want their abortion ban.
@MonicaOBrien331 @PamFromPHMI Yeah there is actually pro choice scripture in the Torah.
"In America we're not supposed to be legislating religion anyway. But if we're going to talk about religion, there is a noticable lack of anti-abortion scripture in the Bible."
@AmoneyResists Yeah I was having similar thoughts. The narrative is predictably being shifted away from what the real issues are.
Don't let these shenanigans with Madison Cawthorne distract from the fact that he is an insurrectionist that should not be holding office.
@TwitterSupport Thanks for that.
@RavBogard Interesting. Evangelicals didn't used to be against abortion either. https://t.co/V7Ila5UTmt
@RonFilipkowski I feel like I should say something but I don't know how to respond to this.
@JahrJon As a constitutional matter that necessitates impeachment inquiries into all three. Purjury is disqualifying for serving on the bench.

HEY REPORTERS: What to know when interpreting polling on abortion over the next week - it'll be confusingüßµ
"24) Finally, what's underpinning opinion? 3 things: Views toward when life begins, control over decisions, and....what else you won't see in these standard polls....views toward women and power: https://t.co/W71HJvFiwd"
23) And you'd miss the forest for the trees - if not be flat out wrong. https://t.co/m8oqSdEhpQ
"22) But if you rely only on a handful of survey Qs, you may understandably come to @Nate_Cohn's (inaccurate) conclusion: https://t.co/m63MwZuybW"
"21) So... these data are confusing if you haven't been conducting qualitative research (which 99.9% of people have not!). Because when you listen to what people say, and measure those sentiments, it becomes much clearer - for most, it's about who has power over these decisions."
"20) On a side note, what does this mean: ""when the woman doesn't want the child for any reason""? And on a side note to a side note, chances are 99% that an older white man wrote this question in about 1973 and it's been asked ever since."
19) And another: https://t.co/oGeEO5Btg4
"18) Another example of how these tracking polls get it wrong: Gallup finds forever the public is ""divided"" between ""pro-choice"" and ""pro-life"" people. But, actually, almost four in ten don't identify with either label (fun survey with @sarahkliff !!) https://t.co/506w3GP4yq"
"17) When we asked a follow-up, we found a majority of respondents said they do NOT want politicians to pass new laws that reflect their response in previous question (!!). https://t.co/DlXjQnGKl7"
"15) Here's another example on 15 week bans (see what we learn when offering an explicit ""don't know"") https://t.co/z9uHyjLhrJ"
14) Here's what we found - just 38% remain in the illegal camp. 62% say legal or don't pass a law/stay out https://t.co/aScGyeSKq8
"13) Then we asked a *follow up* of that 57% who responded ""illegal:"" https://t.co/4vkZ5Py0ry"
"12) Lemme demonstrate. From our recent poll of voters, we replicated a standard Gallup tracking Q that requires respondents to choose legal or illegal: https://t.co/xzgubFZydD"
"11) We're about to see a flurry of polling about Roe, 15 week bans, 6 week bans, etc. My guess is that 95% of these Qs will not ask a key follow-up Q that would entirely change our sense of opinion....."
"10) In fact, the country is not divided. Most support Roe, most support access. Most don't think about this issue until election time - because they don't hear about it until then. It's not polarizing. It's just that everyone *thinks* everyone thinks it's polarizing."
9) Of course we wouldn't know that - from images alone! (Screenshot from my phone last night). Let alone continuing the (inaccurate) narrative that the country is divided and the issue is polarizing https://t.co/matADwoSMU
"8) Do people think abortion is a complex issue, based on each person's circumstances? Absolutely. Do most voters struggle with their position on abortion? They do not."
"7) And be wrong. A few weeks after this story came out, I had an opportunity to ask this Q üëá(Also repeated it a few months ago - found 77% RV saying no) https://t.co/5FTol5tMjr"
"6) So, when reporters are only seeing a handful of questions, and the sources come from respected, smart researchers (asking limited Qs from limited views), they are likely to report things like this: https://t.co/gYhtmnBeTR"
"5) As an aside, sometimes I think understanding opinion on abortion is this simple: https://t.co/hBpBpyXe2R"
4) The Q below is a no-no in polling - having two concepts in one Q. But we still asked it because it's how people think and talk. https://t.co/Tt1r8B8VA1
"3) Also, these researchers are NOT doing focus groups / qual research - listening to people. So they aren't measuring MANY aspects of opinion on the issue. Here are just a few Qs we've asked - straight from the mouths of ordinary people. https://t.co/p69Ke0dkdu"
"2) What you know about opinion comes from very few polls: nyt, wapo, cnn, pew, gallup. These researchers are brilliant, but they only ask surface Qs on abortion. Mostly tracking Qs, which ironically, aren't the Qs to detect major shifts in opinion. https://t.co/q8VMaAOEf7"
"1) After 100s of focus groups and scores of surveys on abortion - here's the bottom line rn. About 50% to 75% of adults support abortion rights and access. Among VOTERS, it's higher - about 60% to 75%. Why? They want people having control over these decisions, not the gov't."

Starbucks will be held accountable for the union-busting minefield they forced workers to walk through in fighting for their right to organize. This Complaint fully unmasks Starbucks‚Äô facade as a ‚Äòprogressive company‚Äô and exposes the truth of Howard Schultz‚Äôs anti-union war.
"Starbucks has been saying that no union busting ever occurred in Buffalo. Today, the NLRB sets the record straight. The Complaint confirms the extent and depravity of Starbucks‚Äô conduct in Western New York for the better part of a year."
"In a major victory for the victims of Starbucks‚Äô worst retaliation, the Region has demanded full reinstatement and back pay for seven workers unlawfully terminated for their organizing efforts."
"This is one of the largest cases in NLRB history &amp; confirms what we‚Äôve been reporting for months- Pres of Starbucks North America Rossann Williams led an army of managers from around the country into Buffalo to spy, threaten, and interfere with workers‚Äô union organizing activity."
"The charges include behavior such as retaliatory terminations, shuttering of pro-union stores, unlawful threats, and oppressive surveillance and intimidation tactics."

The logic was that you can't rape something that isn't considered an independent human being. Your wife's body is yours and you can't rape yourself. This is the logic Alito is upholding when he invokes Matthew Hale. But it gets worse.
"Matthew Hale, just like a lot of Christian extremists today,believed that women were made from Adam's rib. God did not make her an autonomous being with rights. She was a physical extension of his body, made to be his ""helpmeet,"" namely to exist to help him with whatever he wants"

a couple things‚Äî

1. This is actually a State RICO case, not a federal one. I am not from GA, would love to pass the baton to any lovely black lawyers from GA to take it from here

2. I can‚Äôt help your XYZ person in jail üò≠"
"Here is a page that better explains how Proffers work. https://t.co/5kiaQzLRrY

It‚Äôs important in large RICO cases because someone has already/is gonna talk. Here is what that means for other people in the RICO and how that works ‚¨áÔ∏è"
"LONG STORY SHORT: Thug is def in way more trouble than Gunna, but it‚Äôs definitely a bad situation to be in for both. Hope this helped somebody! üò≠"
"‚Ä¶you‚Äôll end up in trouble anyways. It can be appealing in certain situations, so that‚Äôs more chances people will snitch on Thug and Gunna. It‚Äôs a slippery slope and I‚Äôm getting into the weeds."
"There are more rules to this but its a good opportunity to ‚Äúget ahead‚Äù of other things the gov may not know about (or someone else may tell them about)

While the gov cannot use your statements against you, if they can figure it out independently of your statements‚Ä¶"
"last thing: in a Proffer, which is essentially a snitching meeting lol if you agree to cooperate and talk about the gang you get something called ‚Äúuse immunity‚Äù which means the gov cannot use any of the good information you give to charge you with it (directly or indirectly.)"
"A RICO with a lot of ppl charged in it (like this 1) results in many fighting to be ‚Äú1st to the table‚Äù to give the government info they can use to reduce their sentence. The quicker you are, the more likely you‚Äôre giving info the gov doesn‚Äôt already know from someone else."
"Here‚Äôs the bad:

Generally, the government will approach those charged in a RICO for more details on the ‚Äúwho did which acts‚Äù in something called a Proffer. Those who give up the most information first generally get more time off."
(I‚Äôm missing nuance but this is the most uncomplicated way I can think to explain RICO on Twitter lol)
"The feds can now charge all 10 people with arson, murder, carjacking and Hobbs Act Robbery, regardless who which of the 10 people actually did which act. Because with RICO the thought is‚Äîeveryone benefited from the acts of others, therefore everyone is charged with everything."
For example let‚Äôs say there are 10 people in a gang. Three people commit arson to collect insurance money for the gang. Three other people do a murder for hire for the gang. Two people do a carjacking. And two people use the carjacked car to commit a robbery of a 7-11.
RICO stands for Racketeering Influenced and Corruptions (Act). It was created in the 70‚Äôs to take down the Mafia and generally used to indict large groups of people (like gangs) but here are the main things you need to know regarding Thug and Gunna:
"The government (I‚Äôm assuming this RICO is charged federally) is saying there are 56 crimes completed by 28 people as a gang, and these crimes furthered the ‚Äúenterprise‚Äù of the gang. So all 28 people somehow benefited from every crime just because they are all in the same ‚Äúgang‚Äù."

"This isn‚Äôt just a women‚Äôs issue and not just because men will be stuck paying child support, because men will also be parents. This is an issue about power and control by the people in comfortable positions of wealth and privilege within the conservative community &amp; institutions"
While they‚Äôre always true believers - the levers of power have always fought against abortion and to convince you there‚Äôs a moral evil inherent in it for exactly that - POWER. Either to make you a useful idiot who can be financially milked or to control population demographics
Not to mention how the AMA lead the initial crusade against abortion in part to push out midwives but also how prominent doctor &amp; anti-abortion thoughtleader Horatio Storer framed it as ensuring a supply of WASP babies in the face of Catholic &amp; non-white immigrations in 1868
Views on abortion today are now HEAVILY tied to religiosity and intensity with how often one attends church and how deeply the beliefs about damnation and faith are held. https://t.co/Wp9U8JjHd9
Framing abortion away from the well understood right of a woman to control her body and re-writing a narrative about ‚Äúdead babies‚Äù killed three birds with 1 stone and helped to secure Republicans sweeping victories - especially on a rural &amp; state level as the decades progressed
At the same time it also served to allow Republicans to get evangelicals to tolerate Catholics - the group who WAS significantly interested in a forced-birth agenda and traditionally union-membership-holding Democratic voters.
That if they started preaching about how ‚Äúbabies were being murdered‚Äù they could enormously profit off it by endless fundraisers - it became a galvanizing force for an apathetic group that initially didn‚Äôt even solidly vote after their political loss over segregation
"The likes of Chair of the House Republican Conference Jack Kemp, Gerald Ford and the entire Reagan family! who were friendly w &amp; willing to work w Schaeffer to show Evangelical leaders they could have an extremely easy fundraising avenue by stirring up anger &amp; fear over abortion"
Upon being approached by influential ex-Christian filmmaker Frank Schaeffer (who has since denounced his involvement and former work @Frank_Schaeffer) both these massive figureheads initially were opposed TO OPPOSITION of abortion. Schaeffer speaks abt his dad having Rep connects
"Before Reagan &amp; the rapid rise of the religious right in üá∫üá∏, Evangelicals took the approach of ‚Äúthe government should stay out of this matter‚Äù in regards to abortion. Even as late as 1980 Billy Graham and W.A. Criswell (press of Southern Baptist convention) were pro-choice"
Today only behind Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses and Mormons in support for abortion always being illegal is Evangelicals (who are a significantly larger portion of the population). This was not always the case and didn‚Äôt come about organically.

@KatieeSeesAll How does it justify discrimination?
@KatieeSeesAll Disabilities aren't always a factor when judging how much they contribute to society when the state meaningfully helps them though :/ and for the few that it is then that might just be a pill to swallow for me since they are already guaranteed a really good life by the state
"@KatieeSeesAll Also I hope I'm not coming across as aggressive or anything, I'm trying to be good faith"
"@KatieeSeesAll Wait I'm sorry I don't think I understand. Not taking factors like age, race, gender, etc into consideration when judging people just leaves you with the most essential? I wouldn't call someone being hired because they're better than someone else discriminatory"
"@KatieeSeesAll I suppose if there were still problems of inequality in a society which were a socdem utopia then I'd have to see and reassess

From what I've understood a meritocracy just means that everyone is based/judged on their merit instead of other unneccessary factors?"
@foushi19 Omg noooo I'm sorry that sucks
@KatieeSeesAll I think giving everyone a fair playing field in a capitalist system which also has a strong welfare state to ensure everyones living standards are up to snuff is ok. Socdems generally strive for a meritocracy where anyone can have a good happy life and I think that's a good thing

Forgot to put a TW/CW but this is a very sensitive subject
Is something I feel I'll never fully have. The most I can do is give the proper arguments and hope that cis person as a heart to not wanna put trans kids through the hell I experienced growing up
To give them a perspective on why trans rights especially when it comes to trans kids are so important but sometimes in some situations you won't ever be fully understood. To have someone understand the full pain and depth of my experiences
To be a fake person for 15 years because your family hates LGBT people so hide who you are until you can finally be yourself. And this is immensely frustrating. That want to be understood and for people to understand the pain that was your childhood
Most cis people will never understand what it's like to be 12 years old and already wanting to die because you can't be your genuine self. To have self harming genital mutilation dreams every night for years during a puberty you were forced through

Unless you blast every CN show and not just the queer-centric one that dared to be serialized on the network I do not care.

"On a good morning, we‚Äôll have maybe one or two leftover drinks people couldn‚Äôt wait for. Today we ran out of room for them all. It couldn‚Äôt be clearer Starbucks would rather be a full time union busting apparatus than a coffee shop."

Anybody who thinks we do not have an oligarchy right here in America is sorely mistaken. The question before us is whether we will stand with the billionaires and big money interests or will we stand with the working families of this country and protect their interests. https://t.co/p5cY9crY0M
LIVE: The Senate Budget Committee is holding a hearing to discuss how President Biden's budget proposal responds to the major crises facing our nation. https://t.co/msU2Ka7RQe
"Now that the President has submitted his budget plan, it is up to Congress to review it, pass the proposals that make sense and improve upon it. https://t.co/STRACngJOJ"
"Nurses are the backbone of our health care system.¬†Yet, today, nurses are overworked and underpaid ‚Äì and there aren't enough of them.¬†I am working on legislation to address this crisis."
When we talk about oligarchy in America we are talking about 700 billionaires who became nearly $2 trillion richer during the pandemic &amp; pay a lower tax rate than a nurse while the child poverty rate soared by 41% in January because the expanded Child Tax Credit ended.
"Residents should not have to work 80 hours each week in a hospital.¬†It was an honor to meet with residents at UVM Medical Center who are organizing a union in order to provide not only decent wages and working conditions, but to improve care for their patients. https://t.co/krpIKLEsfv"
"RT @USProgressives: Today, on the 7th anniversary of the Saudi-led war in Yemen, progressive lawmakers are calling for an end to U.S. invol‚Ä¶"
"The American people are sick and tired of being ripped-off by corporations making record profits, while working families pay absurd prices for gas, rent and food. The time has come for Congress to work for working families and demand that big corporations pay their fair share. https://t.co/ohPKaKfeCY"
"It makes zero sense to provide $53 billion in corporate welfare to the microchip industry and give $10 billion to Jeff Bezos so he can go to the moon.

I know it is a radical concept, but maybe the government might want to work for working class Americans, not the billionaires. https://t.co/tauhjgmNsl"
"It is imperative that Senators be allowed to vote on whether we should give Jeff Bezos a $10 billion handout to go to the moon and give, with no strings attached, $53 billion to massively profitable microchip companies. I'm going to do all I can to make sure those votes happen."
"Micro-chip companies shut down their plants in the United States and hired cheap labor abroad. Now, the same companies who sold out the American worker, are in line to get $53 billion in corporate welfare. Does that make any sense to you? https://t.co/RaMfPZ1CDH"
We have never seen this level of corporate greed in America. Let‚Äôs go through a few examples. https://t.co/UKj3pev0LN
"At a time of unprecedented greed, the Senate is right now debating giving $53 billion to the highly profitable micro-chip industry and a $10 billion bailout to Jeff Bezos so that he can launch a rocket ship to the moon. I'm LIVE on the floor to oppose it. https://t.co/Q1KriJd8gx"
"I say to Howard Schultz: This is a pivotal moment for Starbucks. As you return to the company, it is time to do the right thing: End the union busting and obey the law. https://t.co/kZ2IZjOv9G"
I‚Äôll be LIVE on the floor of the Senate floor today at 2:30pm ET to oppose a bill that hands $53 billion to profitable microchip companies. The people of this country are sick and tired of corporate greed. We must stand with them.
"Why does Putin fear Alexei Navalny? Because Navalny exposed Putin‚Äôs enormous corruption, and the unimaginable wealth Putin has stolen from the Russian people. That‚Äôs why Putin is trying to discredit and silence him. Release Navalny now!"
"""Medical debt"" and ""Medical bankruptcy"" are two phrases that should not exist in the United States of America. Removing 70% of past-due medical debt from credit reports is a step in the right direction, and much more needs to be done. We must cancel all medical debt. https://t.co/KYHaMK5Iwn"
"Corporate greed is Amazon increasing its profits by 75% last year to a record $35 billion, denying workers a $3 raise, illegally underpaying drivers and blaming a $20 price hike in a Prime membership on ""inflation"" while Jeff Bezos became $81 billion richer during the pandemic."
"In the midst of the current set of horrors ‚Äì war, oligarchy, pandemics, inflation, climate change, etc. ‚Äì we must continue the fight to establish health care as a human right, not a privilege.¬†I will soon be reintroducing our Medicare for All legislation."
"2021 Profits:

Amazon:‚¨ÜÔ∏è75% to $35 billion
Netflix:‚¨ÜÔ∏è96% to $5.3 billion
Nike:‚¨ÜÔ∏è125% to $5.7 billion
FedEx:‚¨ÜÔ∏è307% to $5.2 billion

Amazon Prime:‚¨ÜÔ∏è16.8%
Netflix Subscription:‚¨ÜÔ∏è10.7%
Nike:‚¨ÜÔ∏è10.5%

Don't cite inflation. Cite corporate greed."
Corporate greed is Moderna giving its CEO a $923 million golden parachute &amp; handing out $360 million in stock options to 2 top executives after receiving $2.5 billion from U.S. taxpayers to develop its COVID vaccine &amp; refusing to share it with the world. We must end this greed.
"Here is the untold story of the global economy. Oligarchy reigns and is getting worse.¬†Today, the 10 richest people own more wealth than the bottom 3.1 billion.¬†We need progressive global taxation and an economy that works for all, not a tiny handful of multi-billionaires."
